> A GitHub action that creates a [deploy for a Sentry.io release](https://docs.sentry.io/api/releases/post-release-deploys/).

## What is sentry-release-deploy-action?

A GitHub action that makes is easy to create a deploy for an existing release in Sentry.io based on events in GitHub. Examples:

* a GitHub release is published
* a commit is pushed to master
* a pull request is merged to master

## How does it differ from sentry-releases-action?

[sentry-releases-action](https://github.com/tclindner/sentry-releases-action) is used to create a new release, deploy it, associate commits, and finalize a release. sentry-releases-action should be used to create a release. This action is different because it only creates a deploy for an existing release.

## How do I use it?

First thing first, let's make sure you have the necessary pre-requisites.

### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your repo's `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow---create-a-release) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

#### `version`

**Required** The version being deployed. You can optionally prefix it using `versionPrefix`.

#### `environment`

**Required** The name of the environment the release was deployed to.

#### `versionPrefix`

**Optional** String that is prefixed to the version to form the Sentry release name.

> Please review Sentry's documentation regarding max length and supported characters in release names.

For more information on these inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input)

### Environment Variables

#### `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`

**Required** Sentry auth token.

#### `SENTRY_ORG`

**Required** Sentry organization.

#### `SENTRY_PROJECT`

**Required** Sentry project name.

#### `SENTRY_URL`

**Optional** URL to the Sentry instance, useful for e.g. on-prem deployments.

## Example usage

```yml
name: Create a deploy for a Sentry.io release
uses: tclindner/sentry-release-deploy-action@v1.0.0
env:
  SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
  SENTRY_ORG: myAwesomeOrg
  SENTRY_PROJECT: myAwesomeProject
with:
  version: ${{ github.ref }}
  environment: qa
```

> Note: `sentry-release-deploy-action` will automatically trim `refs/tags/` from `version` if a tag ref is passed. This means you can pass `GITHUB_REF` directly from release events without the need of mutating it first.

### Full example workflow

On every GitHub `release` event.

```yaml
name: ReleaseWorkflow

on:
  release:
    types: [published, prereleased]


jobs:
  releaseApp:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Deploy to dev
        uses: Your action for deployment
      - name: Create a Sentry.io release
        uses: tclindner/sentry-releases-action@v1.0.0
        env:
          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          SENTRY_ORG: myAwesomeOrg
          SENTRY_PROJECT: myAwesomeProject
        with:
          tagName: ${{ github.ref }}
          environment: dev
      - name: Run integration tests against dev
        uses: Your action for testing
      - name: Deploy to qa
        uses: Your action for deployment
      - name: Create a deploy for a Sentry.io release
        uses: tclindner/sentry-release-deploy-action@v1.0.0
        env:
          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          SENTRY_ORG: myAwesomeOrg
          SENTRY_PROJECT: myAwesomeProject
        with:
          version: ${{ github.ref }}
          environment: qa
      - name: Run integration tests against qa
        uses: Your action for testing
```

Assume you tagged your release as `v1.1.0`. `github.ref` would equal `refs/tags/v1.1.0`. This action automatically strips `refs/tags/`, so the Sentry release name is `v1.1.0`.

### Example with optional release prefix

```yaml
name: Create a deploy for a Sentry.io release
uses: tclindner/sentry-release-deploy-action@v1.0.0
env:
  SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
  SENTRY_ORG: myAwesomeOrg
  SENTRY_PROJECT: myAwesomeProject
with:
  version: ${{ github.ref }}
  environment: qa
  versionPrefix: myAwesomeProject-
```

Scenario 1: Assume you tagged your release as `v1.1.0`. `github.ref` would equal `refs/tags/v1.1.0`. This action automatically strips `refs/tags/`, so the Sentry release name is `myAwesomeProject-v1.1.0`.

Scenario 2: Assume you tagged your release as `1.1.0` and you set `releaseNamePrefix` to `myAwesomeProject@`. `github.ref` would equal `refs/tags/1.1.0`. This action automatically strips `refs/tags/`, so the Sentry release name is `myAwesomeProject@1.1.0`.

> Note: This action only works on Linux x86_64 systems.
